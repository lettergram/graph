graph.go
=====

graph.go is an abstracted graphing library for go, currently only containing Dijkstra's Algorithm.

In the future I intend to expand it to enable more versitility, and perhapse a couple of more simple algorithms.

If you decide to improve this library feel free to send a merge request!
